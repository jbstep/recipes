### INGREDIENTS

-   3 1/2 cups finely chopped jalapeño peppers (about  2  lbs.) *see note on peppers
-   1 1/2 cups finely chopped Anaheim and/or Ancho peppers (about  1  to  1 1/4  lbs.)
-   1 1/4 cups cider vinegar
-   3 tablespoons  [Ball Low or No Sugar Flex Batch Pectin](https://amzn.to/2O29NU2)  **see note
-   2 1/2 cups honey

### INSTRUCTIONS

1.  Wash 7 to 8 half-pint (8-ounce) jars and keep warm until needed. Wash lids and rings in soapy water and set aside. Prepare boiling water canner.
2.  Combine peppers and vinegar in a large stockpot, then gradually stir in the pectin.
3.  Stirring constantly, bring mixture to a full rolling boil over high heat that can’t be stirred down.
4.  Add honey, bring back to a full boil and boil hard for 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and skim foam if needed.
5.  Ladle hot jelly into prepared, hot jars, one at a time leaving 1/4-inch headspace. Wipe rim, center lid on jar and attach ring, screwing just until fingertip-tight. Add to rack in canner.
6.  Lower canning rack and process jars in canner for 10 minutes (timing after water comes to a boil with the jars submerged).
7.  Remove jars to a towel-lined surface to cool, undisturbed, for 24 hours. Remove rings, check seals and label with date before storing.

### NOTES

*About peppers:

-   Adjust the peppers as you desire: use less jalapeños and more mild peppers for a less spicy jelly or visa versa – just keep the total pepper amount to 5 cups. You can use any pepper you’d like- hotter peppers like habaneros or even sweet peppers in place of the mild peppers.
-   Also, you can leave the seeds out if you want a milder jalapeño jelly.
-   Remember to use gloves when preparing hot peppers!
-   A food processor makes quick work of chopping all the peppers.

**This is equal to 1 box of low-sugar pectin if you don’t have the Flex Batch.

Also, remember this is a loose jam, not like the stiff pepper jelly. The honey causes it to not set up as well. We’re fine with it that way, but if you want a stiffer end product, you can use half sugar and half honey.
