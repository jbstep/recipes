### Instructions

1. Cut the pork belly into 3 thick chunks so that it cooks more evenly.   
2. Place all ingredients into the inner liner of an Instant Pot or pressure cooker. Cook the pork belly at high pressure for 15 minutes. Allow the pot to sit undisturbed for 10 minutes and then release all remaining pressure. Using a set of tongs, very carefully remove the meat from the pressure cooker. Allow the meat to drain and dry for 10 minutes.    
3. If you do not have a pressure cooker, place the ingredients into a sauce pan, cover, and cook for 60 minutes, until a knife can be easily inserted into the skin-side of the pork belly. Remove the meat and allow the meat to drain and dry for 10 minutes.    
4. Cut each of the three chunks of pork belly into 2 long slices.     
5. Place the pork belly slices in the air fryer basket. Set the air fryer to 400Â°F for 15 minutes or until the fat on the pork belly has crisped up, and then serve.    
    
### Notes

Note: I suspect the nutrition is off on this one since so much of the fat melts off the pork belly, but I don't know how to account for that. The good news is that there are truly no carbs in it, so that's great for keto.

Tips and Tricks:

*   Make sure to let the meat rest to get out the excess moisture for that perfect crispy skin.
*   Pork belly is readily available at most grocery stores, and is inexpensive. A perfect appetizer item for serving a crowd. 
*   If you crisp the skin in the oven, make sure to keep on eye on the broiler. It will go from charred to burnt very quickly.
