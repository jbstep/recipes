### Ingredients:

- 1 pound lean ground beef 90% lean (if you have more meat, double the sauce and save some to add later)
- 2-3 medium carrots, minced
- 3 bell peppers, minced, whatever is on sale
- *2 cups of black kale stems, minced, **optional
- 6 garlic cloves minced
- 1/4 cup packed brown sugar
- 1/4 cup regular soy sauce
- 1/4 cup sriracha sauce
- 2-3 tablespoons of oyster sauce
- 2 teaspoons sesame oil and add extra when finished
- no ground ginger; 1 tbsp fresh grated ginger is optional
- 3-5 red thai chilies minced
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- sliced green onions and sesame seeds for garnish

### Steps:

1. Mince the carrots and bell peppers and set aside(I like to do this the day before).
2. In a small bowl, add garlic cloves, brown sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, sriracha, pepper, ginger, thai chilies.
3. In a large pan or wok, brown ground beef. Before the moisture runs out, add the sauce, carrots, and bell peppers. If you like the veggies more crisp, you can add them at the end but for me I add them to stretch out the meat - so I like them soft and barely noticeable.
4. That's it! Taste at the end and add more oyster sauce, sriracha, sugar, or soy sauce as needed. It seems like a lot, but the veggies add a lot of volume and soak up the salt.
5. You can definitely use any veggies (cabbage, green beans, snap peas, bean sprouts come to mind). I freeze them into portions and microwave on top of rice, add a fried egg and more fresh veggies on top. Hope you guys like this recipe!
