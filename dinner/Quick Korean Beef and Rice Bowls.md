-   Cuisine: Korean

### INGREDIENTS

- 1 lb. ground beef
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 1/2 cups frozen carrots and peas (if you use fresh, dice them small and add them with the meat and garlic)
- 1/4 cup coconut sugar (you can sub brown sugar)
- 1/4 cup reduced sodium soy sauce
- 2 tsp sesame oil
- 1/4 tsp ground ginger
- 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 2 cups prepared brown rice
- sliced green onions and sesame seeds for serving

### INSTRUCTIONS

1.  In a large skillet, add the beef and garlic. Brown over medium heat while using a wooden spoon to break up the meat. Once meat is broken up, add the frozen carrots and peas.
2.  While meat is browning and veggies are cooking, combine coconut sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, red pepper flakes and black pepper in a small bowl. Whisk to Combine.
3.  Once meat is no longer pink and the veggies are tender, pour the sauce over the mixture. Allow it simmer for 1-2 minutes so the flavors can combine.
4.  Remove from heat and serve immediately over prepared brown rice. Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds if desired.

### NOTES

-   Using pre-chopped garlic or the chunky garlic that can be purchased in tubes eliminates all chopping from this recipe.
-   If you don't have frozen carrots/peas or if it will prevent your kids from eating, skip it!
-   This recipe makes 4 servings, but they are small (2 adults, 2 small children). If you are feeding a hunger crowd, double the recipe.
