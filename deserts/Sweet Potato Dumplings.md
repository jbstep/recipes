## How to Make Sweet Potato Dumplings

Step-by-Step

1. Preheat oven to 350° F.
2. Cut each patty in half. Open and unroll the crescent rolls Separate the triangles. Place each sweet potato patty on the wide end of each triangle. As you roll up each sweet potato half in the crescent roll, tuck the ends in. They don't have to be perfect, they don't have to be sealed so it's okay if the sweet potatoes aren't completely covered.
3. After you finish rolling them up, place in an 8"x8" glass baking dish with the pointy end of the crescent roll facing down. If you are doubling this recipe, use a 9"x13" glass baking dish.
4. In a saucepan, combine the water, sugar and cornstarch. Mix well. Add the butter. Heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the butter has melted and the sugar has dissolved.
5. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Pour the sugar mixture over the dumplings. Sprinkle with cinnamon Bake in the preheated 350° F oven for 35 to 40 minutes.
